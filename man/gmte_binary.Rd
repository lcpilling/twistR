\usage{
gmte_binary(Y, T, G, Z, Link = "logit", D, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The binary outcome variable name (string) which appears in data.frame \code{D}.}

\item{T}{The treatment variable name (string) which appears in data.frame \code{D}. Assumed to be binary.}

\item{G}{The genotype variable name (string) which appears in data.frame \code{D}. Normally binary (e.g. comparing homozygous rare individuals to the rest of the population).}

\item{Z}{A string containing the model covariates to appear in the \code{glm()} models (for example "age+sex"). All need to be in data.frame \code{D}.}

\item{Link}{Link function for the \code{glm()} - needs to be one of "logit","probit" or "identity". If unspecified the default is "logit".}

\item{D}{A data.frame containing the above variables.}

\item{alpha}{The p-value threshold for the chi-square test, estimating whether two estimates should be combined. Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{twistR_GMTE} containing the following components:\describe{
\item{\code{CAT}}{The summary statistics from the Corrected As Treated (CAT) analysis.}
\item{\code{GMTE1}}{The summary statistics from the GMTE(1) analysis (i.e. in the treated individuals).}
\item{\code{GMTE0}}{The summary statistics from the GMTE(0) analysis (i.e. in the untreated individuals).}
\item{\code{MR}}{The summary statistics from the MR analysis.}
\item{\code{RGMTE}}{The summary statistics from the Robust GMTE analysis (GMTE1 corrected for GMTE0).}
\item{\code{FullCombined}}{The combined summary statistics from all analyses performed, inclduing combinations.}
}
}
\description{
Performs analyses for the Triangulation WIthin A STudy (TWIST) framework to calcuate the ‘genetically moderated treatment effect’ (GMTE) for a binary outcome. The \code{gmte_binary} function returns an object of class \code{twistR_GMTE}, containing effect estimates from the individual tests (such as RGMTE) and the results when combinations are performed (such as RGMTE+MR).
